# Clustering

For this project, I will be using clustering methods to group FIFA 20 top players (overall>85) by their specific attributes

## Methods used:

1. [K-Means](https://github.com/npvlong/Fifa_Clustering/blob/master/ipynb/Clustering%20-%20KMeans.ipynb)

<img src = "Images/KMeans.PNG" width = "625" height = "500">

2. [DBSCAN](https://github.com/npvlong/Fifa_Clustering/blob/master/ipynb/Clustering%20-%20DBSCAN.ipynb)

<img src = "Images/DBSCAN.PNG" width = "575" height = "500">

3. [Hierarchical](https://github.com/npvlong/Fifa_Clustering/blob/master/ipynb/Clustering%20-%20Hierarchical.ipynb)
